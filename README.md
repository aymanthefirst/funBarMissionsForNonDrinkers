Fun Bar Missions For Non Drinkers
=================================

Project Overview
----------------

Fun Bar Missions For Non Drinkers is an Android application that gamifies the process of going to clubs and bars and talking to people. The goal of the app is to teach people how to have fun without drinking, as well as to push themselves out of their comfort zone and learn to be more social while having fun at the same time.

Installation
------------

The app can be installed by downloading the APK file and installing it on your Android device. Once installed, the app is ready to use.

Usage
-----

When the app is launched, users will be presented with a variety of "missions" that they can complete while at a bar or club. These missions are designed to encourage users to interact with other people and have fun without relying on alcohol.

Users can complete missions alone or with friends, and they can earn points and badges for completing missions. The app also includes a social component, allowing users to connect with other users and share their experiences.

Code
----

The main part of the code for this project is the MainActivity class, which is responsible for setting up the app's UI and handling user interactions. The code includes methods for creating the app's toolbar, setting up a floating action button, and handling menu options.

Future Development
------------------

In the future, we plan to add more missions and features to the app, as well as improve the app's user interface and overall functionality. We also plan to expand the app to include more social features, allowing users to connect with other non-drinkers in their area and share tips and experiences.
